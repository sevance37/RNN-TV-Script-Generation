# RNN-TV-Script-Generation

In this project, I built a RNN to generate a Simpsons TV script. It was trained on part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The RNN was used to generate a script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

This project is from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Program.
